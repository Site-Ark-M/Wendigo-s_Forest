**Welcome to the Wendigo's Forest!**

This was a short solo project that I undertook as a capstone to one of my computing science classes during high school. It may be a bit clunky overall as one one my earlier projects, but it's got heart, and I continue to tweak things here and there.

You are free to download everything any anything! This should compile and run on any computer that can run Java programs. If you have any questions about redistribution/liscensing/the like, contact me.

*Keep in mind*, this project was completed without the use of classes, as that material had not been taught yet. I am working on a sequel in python that will be higher quality in this reguard.
